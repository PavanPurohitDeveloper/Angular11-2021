Child Routes:
- Route can have child routes upto unlimited no. of nested level.
- To work with this we have to follow below steps.


1. Create the Child Routes.
    {path: 'parentPath', component: ComponentName, children: [
      {path: 'childPath', component: ChildComponentName},
      {path: 'childPath', component: ChildComponentName},
      {path: 'childPath', component: ChildComponentName}
    ]}

2. Create the Hyperlinks for Child path.
    <a routerLink = "/parentpath/childpath">Link Text</a>

3. Create the <router-outlet> for child routes ( in the parent route component's template).
    <router-outlet></router-outlet>


Route Guards:
- Guard is nothing but which provides some security.
- Route Guards which provides security for Routing
- The Guard is a service that executes at the specified situation while angular is navigating from one route to another route.
