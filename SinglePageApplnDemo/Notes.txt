SPA:
- It is an application for every request It won't reload the entire page.
- To implement it we use "Routing" mechanism
- Routing - is basically a mechanism to provide the navigation for angular application.
- It is used to map the incoming request to the specified URL in the routing mechanism.

http://localhost:4200/home    --- automatically It maps related component "HomeComponent"
http://localhost:4200/admin   --- automatically It maps to "AdminComponent" and it is getting executed.

- To work with Routing we have to include "RoutingModule" from @angular/core package.

Steps:
- Import the package. (  Verify inside package.json file - "@angular/router": "~11.2.0"  )
- Set the base location for the application on server. ( i.e.  verify inside index.html for base location <base href="/">  BY default slash )
- Import ( Routes ) from "@angular/router".  ( while creating the project If you select routing yes then it will create this file app-routing.module.ts file )
( Step 1 to 3 not required for advanced versions of angular)
- Create the Routes.
- Import the Router "RoutingModule".
- Combine the routes with Router Module.
- Include them in AppModule.
- Create the Hyperlinks by using [routerLink].
- Place holder by using <router-outlet>.
