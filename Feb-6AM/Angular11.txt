### What is Angular ?
-----------------------
Angular is a frontend/client side javascript based framework used to build dynamic web based applications or mobile apps.
Angular we can build SPA (Single Page Application )

whenever we hit the URL on browser, request is processed by the web server
and giving it back to the client web browser..

### difference between Static web page Vs Dynamic Web Page ?
--------------------------------------------------------------
Static web page:
	- which cant change the content
	- HTML, CSS, Bootstrap etc.
Dynamic Web Page: 
	- for every request, which can change the content.
	- javascript, jQuery, Angular JS, Angular, React JS etc
	
Pre-requisites to learn Angular:
---------------------------------
HTML, CSS
Javascript Basics

### difference between AngularJS Vs Angular?
----------------------------------------------
AngularJS is a library..
Angular is a framework where we have lot of libraries integrated..component based architecture..

### what is SPA ?
-------------------
complete content of Web Page is loaded directly once.. for first time..
after that, if u click anyhwere page content will not load .. total page is not going to sent to server..
how much content is required, it will sent to server and return the response back..
we dont send entire page to server..
it improves the performance..
ex: facebook
Lazy loading concept here..

### Environment Setup:
-------------------------
If it is an Angular JS/jQuery library we are integrated with <script> tag.
If it is Angular we must have some setup inorder to build and run the application.
	- NodeJS
	- NPM(Node JS Package Manager)
	- Angular CLI(Commmand Line Interface)
	- Typescript
	- Visual Studio Code(IDE)
	
Node JS:
--------
- It is a server which relays on browser and takes the responsibility to execute Javascript.
- To install node js we click on following link - https://nodejs.org/en/
- To verify NodeJS was installed or not we use "node -v"

> node -v
v14.15.5

NPM(Node JS Package Manager):
-------------------------------
NPM will get installed automatically once Node JS is installed.
once you installed Node JS which will takes responsibility to get the packages from NPM.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/

> npm -v
6.14.11

Typescript:
------------
Typescript is a scripting/programming language. pure Object oriented programming..
typescript compiler is required.

typescript converts into javascript so browser can understand and run

documentation: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/

class Student{
	
	constructor(){
		
	}
	
	public GetData(){
		
	}
}

> npm install -g typescript   //-g global installation
		> npm install -g typescript @3.8
		> npm install -g typescript @latest
		> npm install -g typescript @next  (for beta versions installation)
> tsc -v
Version 4.1.5

Javascript:
-------------
drawback with Javascript..
function Student(){}  //class
function Student(x,y){} //constructor
function GetData(){}   //function

For any queries, you can call or whatsapp us on +91-8179191999 or email us to onlinetraining@nareshit.com

Angular CLI(Commmand Line Interface):
-------------------------------------
used to create angular elements.

documentation:- https://angular.io/guide/setup-local
--------------
> npm install -g @angular/cli

//to verify Angular version..
> ng version    //to verify version
stable version is - 11.2.0

Note: To update the version of Angular, If we already have it in our machine we use below commands
	> npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
	> npm clear cache
	> Restart the computer
	> npm install -g @angular/cli
	

Creating First Application:
-----------------------------
Open the command prompt from where we want to create the application..

D:\MyDevelopment\Angular11\Feb-6AM\MyFirstApp...

> ng new MyFirstApp  --> ng new <nameOfApplication>
	Would you like to add Angular routing? (y/N) : Y
	Which style sheet format ?: CSS

Execute the App --> ng serve(or) ng s (or) ng serve --open(or) ng s -o
> ng s -o -> we use this option often..

How to open the project in visual studio code?
----------------------------------------------------
Open command prompt.
cd D:\MyDevelopment\Angular11\Feb-6AM\MyFirstApp>code .

### Folder Structure:
------------------------
D:\MyDevelopment\Angular11\Feb-6AM\MyFirstApp\e2e

e2e(end to end Testing) ->
It keep track of application things, how your application is getting executed.
Its kind of log information..
	how much time it interacted with components..
	what all the links are visited
	what all the links not visited.

node_modules -> this is the main folder.. contains complete list of packages.. 
				which are required for your project to build the application.
				any 3rd party packages also we can install.. Ex: bootstrap package..
				
*** we can download everything from NPM.

To install the bootstrap?
-------------------------
https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap
npm i bootstrap

Run this command when project does not contains "node_modules" folder ?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
> npm install.  -- It will create "node_modules" folder in your local machine.. and it will install all the necessary files .. 
				It will take information from package.json file and install the relevant packages which are needed to run the application.
and then run the application..

src/app folder --> this is the place where we write our source code w.r.t appln development

assets -- to maintain static files..

environments -> there will be 2 files inside this folder..same appln u running in DEV, SIT, Prod environment..
	All the development/production configuration will be done here..
	environment.prod.ts
	environment.ts
	
favicon --> faviorite icon

index.html --> this is landing page.. this is where appln is landing.. from here only appln execution starts..
				from ui point of view this is main file

main.ts --> is like our main menu..once if you run appln .. bootstrap the app modules.
			from code point of view.. this is main file
			
polyfills.ts --> any browser compatability things.. 

style.css file -> 

test.ts --> this is for global unit test cases..

angular.json --> conatins angular configurations...we have to define globally
	
package-lock.json --> not required this.. any 3rd part packages will track..
	
karma.conf.js --> 

package.json --> contains all the information which is related to packages which are used for project..to run the appln.
				what all the dependencies are required it will download.

DOM - Document Object Model.
----------------------------
For every HTML element at runtime, browser it creates an Object
Collection of Objects which are created for every HTML element.

innerText: will be used to append some context to the HTML elements at runtime, 
           but innerText property will not identify HTML tags in the content.

innerHTML:- will be used to append some context to the HTML elements at runtime, 
            but innerHTML property will identify the HTML tags which are presented in the content.

Javascript Objects:
- Object
- string
- number
- array
- json

Keyboard Events:
	whenever you type any data I want to display something text in lower case or uppercase.

Typescript:

example1.ts
	function Test() {
		var marks = 33;

		var result = "pass";
		if (marks < 35) {
			var result = "fail";
			console.log('Inside the block ' + result);
		}
		console.log('Outside of the block ' + result);
	};

example2.ts
-------------
//enumeration
enum Result { Pass = 1, Fail = -1, Promoted = 0 }

function Student() {

    //members
    let studentId: number = 101;
    let studentName: string = "Shrikanth";
    let isActive: boolean = true;

    //Array declaration
    let marks: Array<number> = [45, 67, 89];
    let total = 0;

    for (let i of marks) {
        total += i;
    }

    let average: number = total / 3.0;

    //creating array in different way
    var courses: string[] = ["HTML", "CSS", "Javascript", "JQuery", "ANgular"];
    //tuple
    let dateOfBirth: [number, string, number] = [22, "Jul", 19889];

    //using enumeration
    let result: Result = Result.Pass;

    //function with expression
    this.result = function () {
        if (average >= 35) {
            return Result.Pass;
        } else {
            return Result.Fail;
        }
    }
}

example3.ts:
-------------
var courses: string[] = ["HTML", "CSS", "Javascript", "JQuery", "ANgular"];

//Normal for loop
for (var i = 0; i < courses.length; i++) {
    console.log(courses[i]);
}

//for each loop ..exeucting another function..
//function without having any name we call callback function.
courses.forEach(function (val, index) {
    console.log(index + "   " + val);

})

//for..in ... is used to print only index values..to iterate index we use this loop..
for (let x in courses) {
    console.log(x);
}

//for..of: Index .. to get the values from collection.
for (let x of courses) {
    console.log(x);
}

Class:
- It is a collection of data members and member functions.
    data members - to strore the data
    member functions - to write business logic
- Object: An Object is an instance of class.
    Physical existence of object.
- OOPS is providing two features    
    - security
    - Reusability
- Any PL, if it is an OOPS it should follow 4 principles
    - Encapsualtion: Binding everything in class ( writing everything inside a class)
    - Abstraction: Hiding the implementation and provide security
    - Poly Morphsim: One to many behaviors
    - Inheritance: Acquiring the properties from one to another.

example4.ts	file:
class Customer {

    //data members/properties
    customerId: number;
    customerName: string;
    customerBal: number;


    //To initialize with data for class members then we use constructor.
    //It is a special method which will invoke when the object of the class is created. automatically constructor will be called.
    //we can have only one constructor in Typescript.
	//mainly used for dependency Injection.
    constructor(custId: number, custName: string, custBal: number) {
        //this - is an object of current class
        this.customerId = custId;
        this.customerName = custName;
        this.customerBal = custBal;
    }

    //Function - returns a value //Method - It contains return type as void
    Display() {

        var message: string = 'Customer ID is: ' + this.customerId
            + " Customer Name is: " + this.customerName
            + ' Customer Balance is: ' + this.customerBal;
        console.log(message);
    }

}

//Object creation // we can use var or let keyword.
//synatx: objectName: className = new ConstructorName();
var cust1: Customer = new Customer(101, 'Srikanth', 15200);
//Accessing the members OR calling methods
cust1.Display();

let cust2: Customer = new Customer(102, 'Diyansh', 25632);
cust2.Display();

How to compile and run ?
> D:\MyDevelopment\Angular11\Feb-6AM\TypeScript>tsc example4.ts

> D:\MyDevelopment\Angular11\Feb-6AM\TypeScript>node example4.js
	Customer ID is: 101 Customer Name is: Srikanth Customer Balance is: 15200
	Customer ID is: 102 Customer Name is: Diyansh Customer Balance is: 25632

----------
Inheritance:
- It is a process of acquiring the properties form one class to another class.
- In TS also we have all different tyoes of Inheritance.
    - Single Inheritance: Single Base class + Single Derived class
    - Multi Level: Different level of classes
    - Heirarichal: Single Parent class + Multiple child classes.
    - Multiple: Multiple parents + Single Child
    - Hybrid: combination of any two
- The gives which gives properties is called Parent/Base/Super class.
- The class which acquire the properties is called Child/Derived/Sub class
- In TS to provide the inheritance between the classes we use "extends"
- Once if parent class is having constructor, in child class we must call it.

- We always create the Object for child classes not to Base class/Parent class.

Constructors for derived classes must contain a 'super' call
super - keyword used to call the parent class constructor.

//Single level Inheritance.. example:
//single parent
class Employee {

    protected EmpId: number; //for data members we follow camel cases
    protected Name: string;
    protected BasicSalary: number;

    constructor(id: number, name: string, salary: number) { //for parameters we follow lower case
        this.EmpId = id;
        this.Name = name;
        this.BasicSalary = salary;
    }

    Display() {
        console.log('Employee Id: ' + this.EmpId + ", Name: " + this.Name + " and Basic Salaru: " + this.BasicSalary);
    }
}

//single child
class Trainer extends Employee {

    protected Subject: string;

    constructor(id: number, name: string, salary: number, subject: string) {
        super(id, name, salary);
        this.Subject = subject;
    }

    Display() {
        //console.log('Employee Id: ' + this.EmpId + ", Name: " + this.Name + " and Basic Salaru: " + this.BasicSalary + " and Subject is: " + this.Subject);
        super.Display();
        console.log('Subject is: ' + this.Subject);
    }
}

var emp: Employee = new Employee(101, 'Raju', 12345);
emp.Display();

var trainer: Trainer = new Trainer(102, 'Srikanth', 12345, 'Angular');
trainer.Display();

Abstract Class:
-----------------
Abstract class and Methods:
- A class for which we have an incomplete functionality, which may be provided in child classes.
- A class which contains atleast one abstract function.
- Abstract function is having only declaration and not the implementation.
- Abstract classes should not be instantiated using new keyword. Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.
- Abstract methods from abstract class we must provide implementation in child class.

abstract class Employee1 {

    protected EmpId: number;
    protected Name: string;
    protected BasicSalary: number;

    constructor(id: number, name: string, salary: number) {
        this.EmpId = id;
        this.Name = name;
        this.BasicSalary = salary;
    }

    abstract calculateSalary(hours: number): void;

    Display() {
        console.log('Employee Id: ' + this.EmpId + ", Name: " + this.Name + " and Basic Salaru: " + this.BasicSalary);
    }
}

class Lecturer extends Employee1 {

    protected Subject: string;

    calculateSalary(hours: number): void {
        let salary: number;
        salary = this.BasicSalary + hours + (this.BasicSalary * hours) * 2.5 / 100;
        console.log('Lecturer Salary: ' + salary);
        //throw new Error("Method not implemented.");
    }

    constructor(id: number, name: string, salary: number, subject: string) {
        super(id, name, salary);
        this.Subject = subject;
    }

    Display() {
        super.Display();
        console.log('Subject is: ' + this.Subject);
    }

}

let emp1: Employee1;
emp1 = new Lecturer(101, 'Srikanth', 12345, 'Angular');
emp1.calculateSalary(8);
emp1.Display();

//To test code:
//tsc example8.ts;
//node example.js

Hierarchical Inheritance:
----------------------------
Single Parent class + Multiple child classes.


Abstract class and Methods:
---------------------------
- A class for which we have an incomplete functionality, which may be provided in child classes.
- A class which contains atleast one abstract function.
- Abstract function is having only declaration and not the implementation.
- Abstract classes should not be instantiated using new keyword. Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.
- Abstract methods from abstract class we must provide implementation in child class.

Interfaces:
-------------
- contains only abstract methods. contains only definitions and does not contain any implementation.
- It is a contract between itself and it's derived class. The contract is interface provides definitions and derived class must provide implementations.
- To create we use "interface" keyword.
- By default everything is "public abstract"
- we use "implements" keyword

export/import:
---------------
- Once you specify export, we can import any where.

example9.ts:
	export interface iArithmetic {

		Add(x: number, y: number): number;
		subtract(x: number, y: number): number;

	}

	export class Arthmetic implements iArithmetic {

		Add(x: number, y: number): number {
			return x + y;
		}

		subtract(x: number, y: number): number {
			return x - y;
		}
	}

example10.ts:
	import { Arthmetic, iArithmetic } from "./example9";

	let obj: iArithmetic = new Arthmetic();
	console.log(obj.Add(100, 200));
	console.log(obj.subtract(100, 50));
	
** Generics also not supported in typescript. but we will use it.	

3-7-2021:  ( Angular session starts here..)
----------
To startup Angular:   Below is the environment setup:
-------------------------------------------------------
1. NodeJS must be installed
	> node -v
2. NPM is required. NPM will be downloaded automatically once NodeJS is installed.
	> npm -v
3. TypeScript must be installed
	> npm install -g typescript
	> tsc -v
4. Angular CLI must be installed
	> npm install -g @angular/cli
	> ng version

Update the angular older version to Angular11:
-----------------------------------------------
1. Uninstall Angular CLI.
	> npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
2. Clear the cache
	> npm cache clear --force
	> npm cache verify
3. Restart the computer
4. Install the latest Angular CLI
	> npm install -g @angular/cli@latest

### Main Building Blocks of Angular?
---------------------------------------
https://angular.io/guide/architecture

1. Component  
2. Template
3. Date Binding
4. Directives
5. Services
6. Dependency Injection
7. Pipes
8. Routing
9. Modules

1. Component is nothing but a typescript class which is used to maintain the state of the component.
	Component is having :
		ts file - is having business logic
		template
		
2. Template is nothing but HTML to display the data to the user.
	Component and Template both are inter related to each other.
	Every component will have Template.
	
3. Date Binding is a mechanism which will be used to share the data from component to template and vice versa.

4. Directives - are used in the template to manipulate the DOM.

5. Services - is a reusable code which used to get the data from the servers and share it to components.

6. Dependency Injection - It is a Design pattern used to Inject the data from service to component class.
						  is a kind of design pattern where you can Inject something.	

7. Pipes - used to transform the data before it displays in the template.

8. Routing - it is a concept of page navigation. To Navigate from one page to another page within appln.
			 whenver you want to develop Single Page Appln we should go for routing mechanism.

9. Modules - which improves the Modularity. grouping of related items belongs to same kind of functionality.
			 Ex: To build the appln, first Identify the modules. 
					based on the business we identify modules - Student, Trainer, Admin
			 By default we get AppComponent, AppModule

### How services and component communication happen ?
-------------------------------------------------------
> using Dependency Injection

### What is Metadata ?
------------------------
*** Metadata will contain information about component.
Ex: app.component.ts 
	@Component({
	  selector: 'app-root',
	  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
	  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
	})

*** Filters are used to process the data.

Building Blocks:
-----------------
1. Component
2. Template  -- is a simple html file
3. Date Binding -- is a mechanism which can be used to share the data from template to the component.
4. Directives
5. Services
6. Dependency Injection -- is a kind of design pattern where you can Inject something.
7. Pipes
8. Routing
9. Modules

- Every Angular element is having 3 parts:
	- import statements  -- it is used to import/get the core packages.
	- decorator   -- is used to write the metadata.
	- export class  -- is used to export/send/gives the functionality.
	
==> import { Component } from '@angular/core'; //@angular/core is a package.

### Components:
------------------
- A Component is main building block of angular, and angular was completely implemented with the help of Components.
- A Component is a reusable UI, which contains state of the page.( contains data of page along with few functionalities).
- A Component is a typescript class which was created with the help of @Component() decorator.
- Component contains metadata.

### Decorator: 
----------------
- Component contains metadata.
- Decorator is used to write the metadata. is like information about the component.
- Decorator is used to differentiate the angular elements from one to another.
			that means If you want to create a component then we will be using @Component{} decorator.
			Suppose if you want to create a Pipe, there we will use @Pipe{}
			Suppose if you want to create a routing mechanism i.e., Module then we will use *ngModule{}
			Suppose if you want to create a Service, there we will use @Injectable{}
			Suppose if you want to create a Module, there we will use @Module{}
Example:
	@Component(
	  {
		selector: 'employee', //selector is used to select the component at runtime.  we can give anyname.
		template: `
		  <div>
			Employee ID is: {{empID}}<br>
			Employee Name is: {{empName}}<br>
			Employee Salary is: {{empSal}}
		  </div>
		  `,
		styles: ['text']
	  }
	)

### difference b/w template and templateUrl ?
----------------------------------------------
template - is mainly used for Inline html. if you want to write html code within component level
templateUrl - you can create in a separate html file and make use of it.

### difference between execution of angular appln using "ng serve" Vs "n g s -o"  ?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> ng s -o  -- it will get open from google chrome browser automatically..
> ng serve -- Here manually you suppose to open the browser and need to run it.

### Execution of Angular:
---------------------------
first file execution will starts from "main.ts".. similar to main() method in java..
from "main.ts" file, Bootstrapping/Initializing the AppModule which is inside "app.module.ts" file.
From "app.module.ts" file, It is Bootstrapping/Initializing the AppComponent.
AppComponent is a component class..AppComponent is getting instantiated with the help of selector.( selector: 'app-root')
 A selector which is used to instatiate the component. which will take the responsibility to get into the Application.
This selector: 'app-root' we will be using inside "index.html" file.
	<body>
		<app-root></app-root>
	</body>

Flow is:
- first request will go to main.ts ..
- From the main.ts we have AppModule.ts ..
- From the AppModule.ts generally , we have AppComponent.ts ..
- From the AppComponent.ts, whatever the selector we are having, we are going to pick the selector, and giving that in the index.html.
- index.html is the starting page to display.. index.html is UI page.
- main.ts is the programming page/file..	

==> first request will go to main.ts ==> AppModule.ts  ==> AppComponent.ts ==> Selector ==> index.html			
		
Module - is the Parent one
Component - is the child one
Every Component must be associated with one module.
Once if you create a component and you to tell explicitly , that must must define in the declarations{} section.
register my component (Ex: EmployeeComponent) and which is as part of AppModule, 
	and if you want to tell explicitly , that must must define in the declarations{} section.


-> First step## Inside app.module.ts - register the component (Ex: EmployeeComponent) for a Module @NgModule().
						  Bootstrap the component which one you want to run..(Ex: EmployeeComponent)
						  
-> second step## Inside index.html, whatever selector we having, same selector has to given like a html.
								    We define only one component inside <body> </body>.. we define outside for all the remaining components.		
-> One component should contain only one templateUrl.
-> We can bootstrap any number of components. its an Array. good practice is define single component.

which component is identified in the bootstrap section of the AppModule that component selector is getting loaded first time..

"app.module.ts" file:	
	@NgModule({

### how to change my angular port number?
------------------------------------------
> ng s -o --port=

3-9-2021: 
----------
"app" folder is the default folder where you can have all the development code..
--> app.component.spec.ts -- This is all about specification file..This is used for unit testing..

Note: By using Angular CLI we create component using a command.
> "ng generate component <name> --options"  | "ng g c <name> --options"

Example:
> ng g c Demo
	It will generate 4 files:
     i. demo.component.html
	 ii. demo.component.css
	 iii. demo.component.ts
	 iv. demo.component.spec.ts
	 
	 D:\MyDevelopment\Angular11-2021\Feb-6AM\ComponentsDemo>ng g c Demo
		CREATE src/app/demo/demo.component.html (19 bytes)
		CREATE src/app/demo/demo.component.spec.ts (612 bytes)
		CREATE src/app/demo/demo.component.ts (267 bytes)
		CREATE src/app/demo/demo.component.css (0 bytes)
		UPDATE src/app/app.module.ts (673 bytes)   --> automatically it will update in app.module.ts file..
	
> ng g c Demo --skip-tests  --> It will skip spec.ts file	
	It will generate 3 files:
		 i. demo.component.html
		 ii. demo.component.css
		 iii. demo.component.ts
	
### Data Binding mechanism:
-----------------------------
- Angular is completely made up of Component only..

- It is a mechanism which can be used to bind/share the data from component to the template and template to the component.

- data binding means, data whatever we having in the component class, if you want to display that data in a template, 
then we suppose to have data binding..

- Data Binding is basically a technique which will allows you to bind the model data to the View Page 
		and View data to the Model.

- Angular is also having kind of MVC ( Model view Controller) kind of architecture. 
	Model is nothing but its data. Model contains only data..
	Controller is nothing but component file.. Controller is going to kick the data and giving it to the View Page.
	View is nothing but html.

- Data Binding is nothing but concept of binding the data from from  HTML to the component and component to the HTML.
		that means, data sharing between these two..
	
In Angular we have two types bindings:
1. One-way Data binding
2. Two-way Data binding

1. One-way Data binding: is something like read-only technique. reading the data.. One Direction.. from Component to template and from template to component.
						 Its always read the data from Model and bind it to the View. Only one time..
						 Suppose View is changing the particular data that is not getting updated on the Models/Component.
						
2. Two-way Data binding: is something bi-directional.. bi-directional means It will read the data from the Component 
						and display it in the template. Suppose from the template if you are doing any modification, and
						same modification will get affected on the component.

One way data binding:- has 3 options:
 - "Interpolation"
 - "property binding"
 - "Event binding"
 
> Interpolation : can we written with {{ }}  --> Component ==> Template
				  - Whenever the component is having something data, that data you want to display it in a template.
				  - is used to get the data from component to template.
				  - we can write some condition also.
				  
		*** If you want to display direct values generally we go with Interpolation sntax.
				
> property/attribute binding: can we written with [ ]   --> Component ==> Template
					-- this also can be used to get the data from component to template.
					Lets say I have property - ename='Srikanth';  ==> In html you display like this -- <h2>{{ename}}<h2>
					
					Lets say I have property - url = "http://www.nareshit.in"  ==> In html you display like this -- <a [href]="url">Naresh IT</a>
					for which attribute, you guys want to assign the property value for that we can give [] square brackets instead of Interpolation synatx.
					
		*** If you want to give any values for the attributes of html then we go with attribute binding sntax.
					
					<dt>URL</dt>
					<dd><a [href]="product.Url">Click here for product Info</a></dd>
					
> Event binding: can we written with ( ) parrenthesis.  -->  Template ==> Component
				   - can be used to handle the data from template to component.. one way direction..
				   Ex: Form submission.
											
Two-way Data binding: this can be written with [( )]  
					  - is something bi-directional..
					  - To implement this - [(ngModel)]   --> I have something in the Template and I want to share it to component.
															  Template <=> Component
															  Or Else I have something in the Component and I Just want to get it and display it on the template. 
					 - Angular handles two-way data binding with the combination of event and property binding.
					 - In this binding once if the value is changed in one place will gets effected in both the places.
					 - To work with this we use [(ngModel)] , which is a directive. this directive is avialble in "@angular/forms" in module "FormsModule".
						import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
					 - Always [(ngModel)] or two-way binding is used for input elements.
			ngModel means- whatever the values we pass on input fields and we capture those values in the component.
					 
		*** whenever I am doing any modification on the component, automatically its getting updated in the HTML.
		    Once if the hTML is affected , that will get displayed on the component.
					 
### when we create a component it implements OnInit ? and what is ngOnInit() method ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
export class DemoComponent implements OnInit {

  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
  }
}

dl - definition list tag
dt - definition term tag
dd - definition data tag

Directives:
------------
- It is used to convert static DOM into dynamic DOM.
- It is responsible to extend the behvaiour of HTML.
- In angular we have few pre-defined directives followed with custom directives.
- There are 3 categories:
	- Component  -- Internally Component itself is directive.
	- Structural Directives - Used to add/remove the HTML elements
		> *ngIf
		> *ngIf then else
		> *ngFor
		> *ngSwitch	
	- Behvaiour Directives - Used to apply dynamic CSS styles/properties.
		> [ngStyle]
		> [ngClass]
	
*** Bootstrap is CSS framework
*** All the modules should be imported in the app.module.ts file under imports section..
	 imports: [
		BrowserModule,
		FormsModule
	  ],

### How we are invoking component ?
--------------------------------------
- using selector

### How to intergate bootstrap into our application ?
--------------------------------------------------------
> npm install bootstrap
> Once the installation is done it will be added to node_modules folder
> To intergate with the application we import it in the styles.css file.
	@import '../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'
> In angular.json file also you can add
	"styles": [
              "src/styles.css"
            ],

### what is *ngIf
--------------------
- It is a Structural Directive which can be used to control the appearance of any HTML element
- It is used to add/remove the HTML elements from the DOM.
- used to work only with boolean value.
synatx:
	<tag *ngIf="boolean"></tag>

	
template reference variable -> ng-template
