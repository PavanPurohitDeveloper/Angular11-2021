    - Including the script by using <script> tag.. Inside the body tag is best option to include script tag.
        <script>
            code..
        </script>
    - Create the variables  by using var
        var x=10;
        var y="welcome"
    - Identify the elements from the DOM.
        document.getElementById()
        document.getElementByName()
        document.getElementByClassName() ..etc
    - Creating Functions
        is a reusable block of code.
        function <functionName>(arguments){

        }
     - Events and Event Handler(Functions)
        Event is an action performed by User. That action can handle by  Event Handler i.e. using Functions  
            <button onclick="funName()" >Click Me</button>

DOM - Document Object Model.
----------------------------
For every HTML element at runtime, browser it creates an Object
Collection of Objects which are created for every HTML element.

innerText: will be used to append some context to the HTML elements at runtime, 
           but innerText property will not identify HTML tags in the content.

innerHTML:- will be used to append some context to the HTML elements at runtime, 
            but innerHTML property will identify the HTML tags which are presented in the content.

Javascript Objects:
- Object
- string
- number
- array
- json

Array:
- It is a collection of items together.
- In JS, we dont have typesaftey so that in an array we can have any type of elements,
- Every element is associated with an index and always index will starts from "Zero".
- In JS Array is a built in object and it provides different methods and properties.

- push
- pop
- splice
- slice

Conditional statements:
- simple if
- if else
- Nested if else


Loops:
- for Loops
- forEach
- while
- do while
- for..in
- for..of

slice() ==> It will return a copy of an array with new elements. 
            we can use slice to get part of the array. one piece. slice means small piece.
            slice(begin, end)
	        returns from begin index to end-1 index
            slice(1, 3)  -> [10, 50]

            var numbers=[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80]
            var num1=numbers.slice(2,5) --> [30,40,50]
            var num2=numbers.slice() --> returns [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80]


splice() ==> It will return a copy of an array with new elements..from this index onwards, I want to remove elements
            I want to remove only 4th element or 5th element.. In that particular position It will add the elements also.
            Ex: [10, 20, 30, 40 , 50]
            splice(1,2, 15, 16)

Arrays and JSON:
- Arrays will store the data based on index, For every element we have index.
- JSON will store the data in key value pair. where Key and value are both user defined.
    var obj = {"empno": 101, "Ename": 'Srikanth', "Salary": 12345};
