Services in Angular:
- A service is also a reusable class, which can be used to share the data from one to many components.
	Ex: I want to retrieve employee data from database.
	I want to use this data into 10 components
	Database ==> Employee ==> Component-1
	Database ==> Employee ==> Component-2
	Database ==> Employee ==> Component-3
								|
							 Service
	data retrieving is common functionality.. Instead of writing in each component..
	Total functionality I will create as separate one using "Service" class
	Each Service is communicating with each components.

- Every service class can have @Injectable() decorator, and this is avaible in core library of angular ('@angular/core').
- We can have few pre-defined services and also we can create our own service as well.
- Every service if we want to make use of it in component/service we use a concept of "Dependency Injection".
- A service can be used in another service also.
- To create a service we use an Angular CLI command like "ng g service <name>".
- Once we create a service we can register and use in 3 ways
    - Global(Angular 9.0)
        @Injectable({
            providedIn:'root'
        })
    - At Module level
        @NgModule({
            providers:[name of service]
        })
    - At Component Level
        @Component({
            providers:[name of service]
        })

Dependency Injection -  is a design pattern. where the Objects are created based on usages.. on-demand Objects creation. Create an Object on-demand basis. we are properly handling the particualr object. Whenever requirement comes, then only the Object will be created.
To Inject the Services.
By using Constructor we do dependency Injection.
