Services in Angular:
- A service is also a reusable class, which can be used to share the data from one to many components.
- Every service class can have @Injectable(), and this is avaible in core library of angular.
- We can have few pre-defined services and also we can create our own service as well.
- Every service if we want to make use of it in component/service we use a concept of "Depedency Injuction".
- A service can be used in another service also.
- To create a service we use an Angular CLI command like "ng g service <name>".
- Once we create a service we can register and use in 3 ways
    - Global(Angular 9.0)
        @Injectable({
            providedIn:'root'
        })
    - At Module level
        @NgModule({
            providers:[name of service]
        })
    - At Component Level
        @Component({
            providers:[name of service]
        })
