Unit Testing:
- It is also a testing process which can be used to test developement code.
- This testing can be done by the developers who developed the code.
- it helps you to identify bugs, any gap or missing the requirements, so that we can fix them and develop the quality product.

- Unit testing is a method, where each unit or component of a software is tested to determine wether it is fit to use or not.
- unit testing can be implemented for all the angular elements like Components, Pipes, Services, Directives beacuse in angular every element is a class.

Note: By default when we create any angular element by using Angular CLI, it creates a seperarte file for unit testing with an extention i.e. "*.spec.ts", where "spec" stands for specification.
- To check the test cases are running fine or not we use a command "ng test".

Environment:
- Node JS
- Angular CLI
- Test Framework like Karma, Jasmin
