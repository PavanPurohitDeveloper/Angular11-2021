Example to connect with server using HttpClient Class:
- HttpClient is a pre-defined class which is used to communicate with server and performing all the CRUD Operations.
- To use this class we need to import a package "@angular/common/http".
- This HttpClient class will return the data in the form of "Observable", where Observable is a type.
- This class will communicate with server and get the updates whenever we have.
- This class is avaible in "RxJS" library.  https://angular.io/guide/rx-library
- "RXJS" is nothing but "Reactive Extensions for JavaScript".
- Mainly used for Communicating with the server and retrieving the data..Performs HTTP requests. This service is available as an injectable class, with methods to perform HTTP requests.
- - HttpClientModule will contain the definition of HttpClient class.. so we need to Import in app.module.ts file.

HttpClient "Get" Method:
- It is used to retrive the data.
- To make any call we need to have an endpoint(URL) and it can be created either by using .Net,Java,Php, MangoDB, JsonDB etc.
- HttpClient methods options
    - HttpHeader
    - HttpParams

*** Basically Every call whatever we making will return the data or accepting the data in the form of JSON only.

HttpClient "Post" Method:
- It is used to insert the data into the server.
- With Post method we suppose to give Url(Endpoint) along with the data.


- Parallel Execution
- Series Execution
- 10 Services suppose if one service is fail it should not effect another.

API endpoint:

### Json server:
locally we can create the data. Its kind of mock data.

To create a Json server...Install JSON Server globally
> C:\MyWorkspace\visual-studio-code-workspace\Angular11-2021\RestCall> npm i json-server

Start JSON Server
> json-server --watch db.json
It creates a db.json file in the project folder.

Now if you go to http://localhost:3000/posts/1, you'll get
http://localhost:3000/posts/
http://localhost:3000/comments/
http://localhost:3000/profile/
http://localhost:3000/contacts
The data whatever we getting it must be in JSON format only.
