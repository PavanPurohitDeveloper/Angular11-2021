Events:
- An event is nothing but an action performed by the user.
- When the event is happend we can handle it by using functions, and we call it as "Event Handlers".

public Insert(){
    //code
}

<button (click)="Insert()"></button>

Examples:
    - Change
    - Mouse Events
        - mouseover
        - mouseout
        - mousedown
        - mouseup
        - mousemove
    - Key Board
        - keyup: Action when key is relesed
        - keydown: Action on hold down of the key
        - keypress: Action when new key used after the current.
    - Animations
    - Timer etc.

### $event:
    <input type="button" (click)="F1($event)" value="Red">
    <input type="button" (click)="F1($event)" value="Green">
    <input type="button" (click)="F1($event)" value="Blue">

If user click on Red this function is called..generall way
    F1(X) {
        x.target.value
        //code
    }
    how we can differentiate, From which button the event had been fired and this function will get execute.?
    To identify from which button the event has been fired, In javascript we have $event is available.

    $event: will get the refernce of the particular button, from which button the event has been fired, will get the entire reference of this element.
    whenever you having same function with multiple HTML elements then to identify from where the event has been fired.
