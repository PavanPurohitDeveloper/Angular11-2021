Forms in Angular:
- Form is used to take input from the user.
- To implment the forms we have two ways
    - Template Driven Forms
    - Model Driven (or) Reactive forms

Template Driven Forms:
- These are suitable for development of simple forms with limited input elements.
- Each field represented as a property in component class.
- Validation rules are applied with HTML5 vaildation  attributes.
- "FormModule" has to be imported.

HTML5 Validation attributes:
- required
- minlength
- pattern
- maxlength

Validation properties in angular:
- untouched: If focus is not there until it will return true.
- touched: Once foucs is there then it will return true.
- pristine: If focus is there, but user not modify the default value.
- dirty: If the default value has changed, then it will be dirty.
- valid: If all the validation controls true, then valid
- invalid: If a single validation property returns true then invalid.
- errors: It is object of errors.

Model/Reactive Forms:
- These are the new forms, which are suitable for creating large forms with many input fileds and complex validations.
- In these forms, each input filed is represented as "FormControl" and group of controls are represneted as "FormGroup".
- "ReactiveFormsModule" should be imported from "@angular/forms" package.
- Validations rules are defined in the component by using "Validators" object.

Validators.required
Validators.minlength
Validators.maxlength
Validators.pattern
