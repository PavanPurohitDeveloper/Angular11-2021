Unit Testing:
- Unit Testing is a process of testing the individual component, whether it is working correctly or not before we are sending the code into QA environment.
- Developers will takes the responsibility to write the unit test cases before sending the code.
- To do the unit testing we use "Jasmine" and "Karma" frameworks.
- In angular to write the test cases we use "*.component.spec.ts" files.

Example:
function Add(x: number, y: number) {
	if(NaN(x) || Nan(y)) {
		console.log('It should be a number');
	}
	return x+y;
}
Add("10", "20");  ==> 1020   ==> Test Failed
Add(10, "20") 	  ==> It should be a number ==> Test is Success


Jasmine: Used to create the testcases.
Karma: Used to executes the test cases in multiple browsers.
Protractor: Used to execute the test cases on single browser(Outdated).

Dev Env <=> QA/Testing Env => Production Env

- All the test cases are represented with a function i.e. "describe()"
- Each test case is represented with a function i.e. "it()".
- Suppose if we want to execute some logic and that logic can be used for ultiple times then we use "beforeEach()".
- To create a test module we use "TestBed.configureTestingModule()"
