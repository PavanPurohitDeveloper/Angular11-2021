JavaScript:
- HTML is used for describing the content on the browser
- CSS is used for Styling the HTML elements.
- Both HTML, CSS and Bootstrap are mainly used to design static pages.
- JS is used to prepare dynamic web pages. generate the content dynamically.
- It is scripting language which will be used to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) at runtime, by chnaging the behavior of
 the elements and also used to add/remove the HTML elements.

documentation to learn: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript

- Important Notes:
    - Whenever HTML is loaded if you want to apply some styles then we should go with CSS. 
    - JavaScript needs to be executed after loading the HTML and CSS. 
    1. Including the script by using <script> tag.. Inside the body tag is best option compare with head tag to include script tag.
        <script>
            code..
        </script>
        
    2. Create the variables  by using "var"/"let"/"const"
        var x=10;
        var y="welcome"
        x = 22.3f;
        x = 123.45;
        x = true;

    3. Identify the elements from the DOM.
        document.getElementById()
        document.getElementByName()
        document.getElementByClassName() ..etc

    4. Creating Functions
        is a reusable block of code which is getting executed again and again.
        Arrow function also available.
        function <functionName>(arguments) {

        }

    5. Events and Event Handler(Functions)
        Event is an action performed by the User. That action can handle by  Event Handler with the help of Functions.
            <button onclick="funName()" >Click Me</button>

     6. Type casting  (Optional)
        var x = 10;
        var y = 20;
        var z = x + y;  //30

 ### Which version of Javascript you are using?
------------------------------------
ECMAScript latest version - ES6
JS is not having any version numbers..   

Add the below extensions in Visual studio:
-------------------------------------------
> Angular Snippets (Version 11)
> HTML CSS Support
> open in browser
> Bootstrap 4, Font awesome 4, Font Awesome 5 Free & Pro snippets

DOM - Document Object Model.
----------------------------
Once the HTML document is getting executed and rendered on browser ( run on the browser), Every element will be converted to DOM.
For every HTML element at runtime, browser it creates an Object
Collection of Objects which are created for every HTML element.

innerText: will be used to append some content to the HTML elements at runtime, 
           but innerText property will not identify HTML tags in the content.

innerHTML:- will be used to append some content to the HTML elements at runtime, 
            but innerHTML property will identify the HTML tags which are presented in the content.


<label> is a tag where we can display the text.

>> There are 3 types of buttons
    1. normal "button": 
    2. "submit" button : is used to submit something to the server. 
                Make sure All these input elements should be wrapped with the <form> tag. If we are not having <form> tag then "submit" button will not work.
    3. "reset" button: 

>>> <label for:  Highliting the Password text box..
            The main advantage of "for" attribute with <label> tag is - whatever the id we are having for the input element, if we can give the same Id then automatically if user click on this particular label then corresponding input element is focussed.
       Example:
        <label for="pwd">Enter Passpord: </label>
        <input type="password" name="pwd" id="pwd">

Developer Tools:
    1. Elements tab: what are all the elements having in the browser, It will give you clear idea. contains the HTML elements structure.
    2. Console tab: is mainly used to get Error messages or anything you can print. to diplay normal messages also.
    3. Sources tab: is used for debugging code purpose.
        CTRL+P -- gives you all the list of files.
        Open the file and put breakpoint
        press "F10": line by line execution
    3. Network tab: 

 Mouse Events:
 1. onmouseover
 2. onmouseout   

 Keyboard Events:
 Ex: User will enter something in textbox and display the text in lowercase and upper case.
    whenever you type any data I want to display something text in lower case or uppercase.
 1. onkeypress
 2. onkeyup
 3. onkeydown

Javascript Objects:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects
- Object
- string
- number
- array  ( Map also comes under the array)
- json

Array:
- It is a collection of items together.
- In JS, we dont have typesaftey so that in an array we can have any type of elements,
- Every elements is associated with an index and always index will starts from "Zero".
- In JS Array is a built in object and it provides different methods and properties.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

-> push  : Adds one or more elements to the end of an array, and returns the new length of the array.
-> pop   : Removes the last element from an array and returns that element. 
           Which is always going to remove last element
-> splice
-> slice

Conditional statements:
- simple if
- if else
- Nested if else
- if else ladder
- switch

Loops:
- for Loops
- forEach
- while
- do while
- for..in
- for..of

splice(index, how_many_elements_to_remove) ==> 
            It will return a new copy of an array with new elements..from this index onwards, I want to remove elements..
            I want to remove only 4th element or 5th element.. In that particular position It will add the elements also.
            Ex: [10, 20, 30, 40 , 50]
            splice(1,2, 15, 16)  ==> [10, 15, 16, 40, 50]
            *** splice() is not only used to remove the elements but also used to add the elements.

            var BR = Splice(1,2,15,16);
            var list1 = document.getElementById();
            for(var i=0; i < BR.length; i++) {
                list.innerHTML = "<li>" + BR[i] + "</li>";
            }

slice() ==> It will return a new copy of an array with new elements. 
            we can use slice to get part of the array. one piece. slice means small piece.
            slice(begin, end)
	        returns from begin index to end-1 index
            slice(1, 3)  -> [10, 50]

            var numbers=[10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80]
            var num1=numbers.slice(2,5) --> [30,40,50]
            var num2=numbers.slice() --> returns [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80]

            var BR =  slice(1, 3);

Arrays and JSON:
- Arrays will store the data based on index, For every element we have index.
- JSON will store the data in key value pair. where Key and value are both user defined.
    var obj = {"empno": 101, "Ename": 'Srikanth', "Salary": 12345};
